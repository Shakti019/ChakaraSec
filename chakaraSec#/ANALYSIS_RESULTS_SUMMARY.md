## Key Findings

### 1. Machine Learning Model Performance

The Random Forest Regression model achieved **exceptional accuracy**:
- **R² Score:** 0.995 (±0.000)
- **Model Type:** Random Forest with 100 estimators
- **Target Variable:** Security Score (0-100)

### 2. Feature Importance Analysis

The ML model identified the most critical security parameters:

| Feature | Importance | Impact |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Entropy Bits** | 42.31% | 🔴 Critical |
| **Puzzle Entropy** | 28.83% | 🔴 Critical |
| **Number of Layers** | 27.49% | 🔴 Critical |
| **Puzzle Window** | 1.28% | 🟡 Moderate |
| **Compute Factor** | 0.03% | 🟢 Low |
| **Parallel Bots** | 0.03% | 🟢 Low |

| **Custodian Threshold** | 0.01% | 🟢 Low |

**Key Insight:** The top 3 features (Entropy, Puzzle Entropy, Layers) account for **98.6%** of security variance!

### 3. Power Law Relationship

Statistical analysis revealed a **power law relationship** between entropy and time to break:

```
Time to Break = 5.64 × entropy^1.81 seconds
```

This means security increases **exponentially** with entropy bits!

### 4. Risk Assessment

- **High Risk Configurations** (>50% attack success): **0** ✅
- **Low Risk Configurations** (<10% attack success): **8,164** (81.6%) ✅
- **Zero successful attacks** in properly configured systems

### 5. Security Metrics Summary

| Metric | Mean Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Time to Break | 1.45 × 10⁶ seconds | ~17 days average |
| Attack Success Rate | 0.086 (8.6%) | Excellent defense |
| Detection Rate | 0.742 (74.2%) | Very good |
| Security Score | 62.1 / 100 | Solid security |
| Legitimate User Latency | 0.089 seconds | Excellent UX |
